      <h2>The Life of a Genius</h2>
      
      <p>Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h3>Turing's Legacy</h3>
      <p>Turing's work has had an enormous impact on our world. His theoretical concepts laid the groundwork for modern computing, and his wartime cryptanalysis work at Bletchley Park is estimated to have shortened World War II by several years, potentially saving millions of lives. The annual Turing Award, established in 1966, is considered the highest distinction in computer science—equivalent to the Nobel Prize in the field.</p>
